Getting Started
********************
With the treemap extension plugin for vim you can create treemaps with the
output in a textfile or an imbedded SVG HTML file.
(SLICE and DICE)

For further details read the vim help file: "help treemap"

First install the plugin: |treemap-install|

To start the treemap creation:
- load the inputfile
- set the separator (;|,|\t|...) in the menu Plugin->Treemap->Separator
  or with the VIM Command :TmSeparator (<leader>tr)
- set the output type 'VIM' or 'SVG' in the menu Plugin->Treemap->Output Type
  or with the VIM Command :TmOutput
- Run the treemap script in the menu Plugin->Treemap->Run    
  or with the VIM Command :TmRun
  OR
  call the main function: call treemap#main(output,separator)
  for example: - call treemap#main('VIM','\t')
               - call treemap#main(g:tmOutput,g:tmSeparator)
 
Note:
Set tho option wrap to 'nowrap'
  :set nowrap!
Otherwise the treemap is displayed wrong. You can set this
option also after drawing the treemap!

Note:                                                        
The decimal separator for the input file is in every language
the point "."                                                
examples:   23.1                                        
               1020.23                                       


Use commands |TmCreate| and |TmDraw| instead of |TmRun|.

If you get an error message you can find help for this error in the help file. Type :help ERROR-ID.
example: :help E0003
